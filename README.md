# DeepLearning

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks and scripts designed to demonstrate various deep learning concepts and techniques. These materials are suitable for both beginners and intermediate learners who want to understand and apply deep learning algorithms using Python and popular libraries such as PyTorch and scikit-learn.

## Overview

The repository is organized into several sections, each focusing on different aspects of deep learning, including:

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Linear Classifiers**
- **Backpropagation**
- **Computation Graphs in PyTorch**
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
- **Introduction to PyTorch**

Each section includes practical examples and visualizations to help you grasp the underlying principles and how to implement them.
